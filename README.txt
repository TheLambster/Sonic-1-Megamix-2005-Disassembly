This is a disassembly of the very first Sonic 1 Megamix version.

There are some differences to the original ROM to the one you build in this disassembly, 2 differences include, the HUD is in the same spot as the original game, and the explosion sound is different. But it is very close to the original, I have also ported the Sonic 2 Level select, the Sonic 2 Simon Wai spindash, the Sonic ERaZor Sonic sprites, deleted the speed caps, and installed MegaPCM.

This disassembly is based off of the Hivebrain 2005 disassembly, because the GitHub disassembly sucks.

All credit goes to anyone’s work that I used in this disassembly.

I have put both all of the maps and Nemesis art in a zip file, so before you build and see that it's broken, extract those 2 zips, also, if you think the assembler is broken, it isn't, I only deleted the checksum.
